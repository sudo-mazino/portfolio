      <p className='ml-3 text-[14px] text-justify mr-3 '>I'm Ansh Sharma, a third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science (Data Science) at LNCTE, Bhopal, passionate about building systems from the ground up â€” from a basic x86 operating systems and Java-based neural networks to full-stack web apps. I enjoy low-level programming, machine learning, and solving real-world problems through tech. I'm an open-source contributor, bug hunter, and co-author of a published IEEE paper on sign language recognition presented at ICOCIT 2024. Always eager to explore, I actively participate in hackathons, tech talks, and conferences.</p>
